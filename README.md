## Design
### Colour Scheme
The two main colours used on this site #d0b3b7 and #985d65.  
The navbar transitions between #d0b3b7 and #985d65.
The page background color chosen is #efefef.


### Typography
The main fonts used are Bangers and Roboto from Google Fonts. Bangers is the style of the brand logo so it is continued in a descrete fashion throughout the site on the buttons which bring the user through the full visit and checkout experience. It was chosen as it reflects a casual yet sharp style. Roboto is used for all other text as it is a clean well spaced font and easy on the eye.

### Source libraries  
1. Django framework
2. Bootstrap4 
3. Fontawesome  
4. Stripe javascript  
5. jQuery

Home app views:
- index  
- about
Home app url's:
- path('', views.index, name='home')
- path('about/', views.about, name='about')  

### Products App  
This app holds the files for all the product applications such as the Products page and Product Details page. It also contains the files for the Admin Product Management for adding, editing, deleting Products from the site.  

Products app views:

- path('add/<item_id>/', views.add_to_shopping_bag, name='add_to_shopping_bag')
- path('edit/<item_id>/', views.edit_shopping_bag, name='edit_shopping_bag')
- path('remove/<item_id>/', views.remove_from_shopping_bag, name='remove_from_shopping_bag')

Shopping Bag context_processor:  
A context processor is used for storing the users shopping bag contents so it is available for accessing site wide.  

### Checkout App  
This checkout app holds all the files and functionality for a user to purchase a product securely and it contains the payment gateway to Stripe.  

Checkout app views:
- checkout  
- checkout_success  
- cache_checkout_data  

Checkout app url's:  
- path('', views.checkout, name='checkout')
- path('checkout_success/<order_number>', views.checkout_success, name='checkout_success')
- path('cache_checkout_data/', views.cache_checkout_data, name='cache_checkout_data')
- path('WH/', webhook, name='webhook')

### Checkout App order number generator (uuid)  
To generate a unique order number for each order Django uuid is used. This will give a random string of 32 characters as a unique identifier to each order submitted.  

### Stripe checkput
1. The checkout view creates a Stripe paymentIntent  
2. Stripe returns the client_secret, which is returned to the template  
3. Using JavaScript on the client side, call the confirm card payment method from stripe js useing the client_secret in the template to call confirmCardPayment() and verify the card.  

### Stripe webhook  
1. Create a new file checkout/webhook_handler.py
2. Add webhook methods for:
    - Unhandled webhooks
    - Payment succeeded
    - Payment failed/declined
3. Add a URL path to this file in checkout/urls.py and import the webhooks function from .webhooks  
4. Create a new file checkout/webhooks.py to listen for Stripe Webhooks  
[Stripe docs - Payment intents](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/handling-payment-events)  
5. In settings.py set the stripe webhook secret key from the environment variables  
6. Add a webhook endpoint in Stripe dashboard/Developers/webhooks/add endpoint 
    - endpoint url: site_url + /checkout/WH/  
    - Select 'Receive all events'
    - Click 'Add endpoint'
7. Copy the signing secret key and export it to the project using the terminal.
    - export STRIPE_WH_SECRET='webhhok secret key'
8. Use the wehooks listener to map the webhook and event type and pass it to the webhook handler  
9. Create the necessary database objects in the webhook handler
    - In stripe_elements.js add the billing details and shipping details from the form to the Stripe.confirmCardPayment method 
    so they can be passed to Stripe to be included in the webhook response 
10. Cache checkout data if user checks save info box  
    - Create a new view cache_checkout_data in order to modify the payment intent and add some metadata to it.
    - Pass the client_secret from the payment intent  
    - Extract the payment intent id from the client secret key  
    - Call the paymentIntent.modify method from Stripe passing in the clientid and the extra data to be added.
    - Add a url to the cache_checkout_data view  
11. In stripe_elements.js add the save-info data to the form.addEventListener

### Django Countries for use with Stripe  
The Stripe payment gateway requires a 2 character abbreviation for the country field. In order to prevent user error and to ensure the country field return a 2 character string Django Countries is used. This gives us the ability to load the country field with the labels set as the full country name but the value will be the 2 character string of the country selected.
- pip3 install django-Countries
- pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

### Profiles App  
The profiles app contains the files for storing users personal credentials.  

Profiles app views:
- profile  
- order_history
- add_review  
- edit_review 
- delete_review  

Profiles app url's:  
- path('', views.profile, name='profile'),
- path('order_history/<order_number>',  views.order_history, name='order_history')
- path('add_review/<product_id>/', views.add_review, name='add_review')
- path('edit_review/<review_id>/', views.edit_review, name='edit_review')
- path('delete_review/<review_id>/', views.delete_review, name='delete_review')

## CSS stylesheets  
In development environment: 
CSS stylesheets can be kept locally or globally. Global CSS stylesheets are held in the root level static folder. Local CSS stylesheets can be held in the App static folders.  
In production environment: 
All stylesheet files are held in the AWS project bucket/static.

## Media files  
All images are image responsive and keep their aspect ratio. 

In development environment all media files are held in the root level media folder.  
In production environment all media files are held in the AWS project bucket/media.  

## Testing  
[TESTING.md](https://github.com/PeterKellett/project-4/blob/master/TESTING.md)  

## Bugs and troubleshooting  
### HTML and CSS  
Most html and css bugs related to alignment, paddings and margins. These were resolved using the browser development tools to inspect the page to see the respective html elements and so could adjust accordingly.  
Particular elements that took time to get right was the sidebar on the products page and styling the sidebar checkboxes.  
A fix was also required to prevent horizontal scrolling which was acheived by adding max-width:100% and overflow-x: hidden body css element.  
[Horizontal scroll screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfboxofas/image/upload/v1612004911/project-4/readme/horizontal_scroll_bug-screenshot_cutrpo.jpg)  
[Dev tools screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfboxofas/image/upload/v1611953708/project-4/readme/dev_tools-screenshot_i6abxu.jpg)  

### JavaScript  
JavaScript bugs were resolved using the browser debug tools along with using the console.log() command placed in the script to print a statement to the console as a confirmation check on whether the code is being executed or not.  
[Debug tools screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfboxofas/image/upload/v1611954062/project-4/readme/debug_tool-screenshot_xpnekq.jpg)

### Python 
- Jinja template errors:   
With debug set to True in the development environment any template syntax errors are displayed in the browser. This will give the type of error and the line of code producing the error.    
[Template syntax error screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfboxofas/image/upload/v1611956571/project-4/readme/template_errors-screenshot_sennqu.jpg)  

- Python variables errors:  
Variable errors can be diagnosed in the same fashion by using the debug tool to show the variables available in the browser errors.  
[Template variables error screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfboxofas/image/upload/v1611956571/project-4/readme/template_errors-screenshot_sennqu.jpg)  
The python print statement was also used to debug the key value pairs of objects and dictionaries by printing the contents to the terminal. In this way the type and format can easily be seen and inspected thus making any errors in them easier to debug.  
[Terminal window screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfboxofas/image/upload/v1611958396/project-4/readme/terminal_print-screenshot_dakax1.jpg)

- Django context_processor omission for media files:  
On deployment to AWS S3 storage the media files were not being rendered on the deployed site. I was unable to diagnose and fix this bug as there were no errors as such. I had to contact tutor support who were quick to advise me that the media context_processor was not automatically added to the Django contexts_processors list in settings.py. Simply by adding a media context_processor to this list fixed the bug. 

## Deployment  
This projects repository is held in GitHub and is hosted with Heroku Apps. Deployment to Heroku Apps is done from the GitHub master branch.

2. Change the SECRET_KEY setting in setting.py to read it from the os environment Config Vars  
3. Set the DEBUG flag to True only if DEVELOPMENT is in the environment  

# AWS
1. Create a new AWS s3 bucket to store static and media files.  

## Configure bucket settings  
1. In Properties, turn on Static website hosting. 
    - Set Index document to index.html (Unused but are required fields)
    - Set Error document to error.html (Unused but are required fields)
2. In Permissions set up the cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) 
3. In Permissions generate a new bucket policy number  
    - Set Policy type = s3 bucket policy
