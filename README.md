## Design
### Colour Scheme
The two main colours used on this site #d0b3b7 and #985d65.  

### Typography
The main fonts used are Bangers and Roboto from Google Fonts. Bangers is the style of the brand logo so it is continued in a descrete fashion throughout the site on the buttons which bring the user through the full visit and checkout experience. It was chosen as it reflects a casual yet sharp style. Roboto is used for all other text as it is a clean well spaced font and easy on the eye.

### Source libraries  
1. Django framework
2. Bootstrap4 
3. Fontawesome  
4. Stripe javascript  
5. jQuery

Shopping Bag context_processor:  
A context processor is used for storing the users shopping bag contents so it is available for accessing site wide.  

### Checkout App  
This checkout app holds all the files and functionality for a user to purchase a product securely and it contains the payment gateway to Stripe.  

Checkout app views:
- checkout  
- checkout_success

Checkout app url's:  
- path('', views.checkout, name='checkout')
- path('checkout_success/<order_number>', views.checkout_success, name='checkout_success')
- path('cache_checkout_data/', views.cache_checkout_data, name='cache_checkout_data')
- path('WH/', webhook, name='webhook')

## Checkout App order number generator (uuid)  
To generate a unique order number for each order Django uuid is used. This will give a random string of 32 characters as a unique identifier to each order submitted.  

### Stripe checkput
1. The checkout view creates a Stripe paymentIntent  
2. Stripe returns the client_secret, which is returned to the template  
3. Using JavaScript on the client side, call the confirm card payment method from stripe js useing the client_secret in the template to call confirmCardPayment() and verify the card.  

### Stripe webhook  
1. Create a new file checkout/webhook_handler.py
2. Add webhook methods for:
    - Unhandled webhooks
    - Payment succeeded
    - Payment failed/declined
3. Add a URL path to this file in checkout/urls.py and import the webhooks function from .webhooks  
4. Create a new file checkout/webhooks.py to listen for Stripe Webhooks
    [Stripe docs - Payment intents](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/handling-payment-events)  
5. In settings.py set the stripe webhook secret key from the environment variables  
6. Add a webhook endpoint in Stripe dashboard/Developers/webhooks/add endpoint 
    - endpoint url: https://8000-c613707c-ac21-4c3b-9ef3-d0af7fd6591c.ws-eu03.gitpod.io/checkout/WH/  
    - Select 'Receive all events'
    - Click 'Add endpoint'
7. Copy the signing secret key and export it to the project using the terminal.
    - export STRIPE_WH_SECRET='webhhok secret key'
8. Use the wehooks listener to map the webhook and event type and pass it to the webhook handler  
9. Create the necessary database objects in the webhook handler
    - In stripe_elements.js add the billing details and shipping details from the form to the Stripe.confirmCardPayment method 
    so they can be passed to Stripe to be included in the webhook response  
10. Cache checkout data if user checks save info box  
    - Create a new view cache_checkout_data in order to modify the payment intent and add some metadata to it.
    - Pass the client_secret from the payment intent  
    - Extract the payment intent id from the client secret key  
    - Call the paymentIntent.modify method from Stripe passing in the clientid and the extra data to be added.
    - Add a url to the cache_checkout_data view  
11. In stripe_elements.js add the save-info data to the form.addEventListener

### Django Countries for use with Stripe  
The Stripe payment gateway requires a 2 character abbreviation for the country field. In order to prevent user error and to ensure the country field return a 2 character string Django Countries is used. This gives us the ability to load the country field with the labels set as the full country name but the value will be the 2 character string of the country selected.
- pip3 install django-Countries
- pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

### Profiles App  
The profiles app contains the files for storing users personal credentials.  

Profiles app views:
- profile  
- order_history
- add_review  
- edit_review 
- delete_review  

Profiles app url's:  
- path('', views.profile, name='profile'),
- path('order_history/<order_number>',  views.order_history, name='order_history')
- path('add_review/<product_id>/', views.add_review, name='add_review')
- path('edit_review/<review_id>/', views.edit_review, name='edit_review')
- path('delete_review/<review_id>/', views.delete_review, name='delete_review')

## CSS stylesheets  
In development environment: 
CSS stylesheets can be kept locally or globally. Global CSS stylesheets are held in the root level static folder. Local CSS stylesheets can be held in the App static folders.  
In production environment: 
All stylesheet files are held in the AWS project bucket/static.

## Media files  
In development environment: 
Media files are held in the root level media folder.  
In production environment: 
All media files are held in the AWS project bucket/media. 

## Testing

2. Verify email verification page is displayed.
3. Verify verification email is received.
4. Verify visiting the link in the email completes the registration process.  

#### allAuth Login/logout test
1. Go to login in page and submit the form.
2. Verify user is logged in correctly.  
3. Click logout link in navbar and verify user is logged out correctly.

#### Sidebar filter tests

3. Uncheck some of the checkboxes and verify the products are filtered out correctly.  
4. Verify the All checkbox checks and unchecks all other checkboxes in the sidebar menu.  

#### Product details test  
1. Go to product details of a product.  
2. Verify a user can select quantities and size of a particular product.  

#### Reviews  
1. Verify the reviews modal on a product with reviews opens and closes.
2. Verify all reviews for that product are listed on the modal.  

#### Add/Edit/Delete reviews test  
1. Verify a user must be logged in to be able to add a review.
2. Log in and add a review to a product.  
3. Go to profile page, edit and verify the review can be edited and deleted.  
4. Add another review and log out.
5. Verify the review added cannot be edited by entering /edit_review/<review_id> in the url.  
6. Verify the review added cannot be deleted by entering /delete_review/<review_id> in the url.  

#### Shopping bag test
1. Add several items of various sizes and quantities of each.
2. Click on the shopping bag icon in the navbar to go to the shopping bag page.  
3. Verify size, quantities and subtotals are correct for each item added.
4. Verify total, delivery, and grand totals are correct.  
5. Verify a user can edit and delete any item in their shopping bag. 

#### Checkout test  
1. Go to checkout page and submit the form using a Stripe test card number.  
    - [Stripe docs - Testing](https://stripe.com/docs/testing)
2. Verify the user is brought to the checkout success page with the order details displayed.  
3. Go to Stripe dashboard > Developers > logs and verify a payment intent was created, the payment was charged, and the payment was successful.  

#### Checkout Stripe webhook test  
In case there is a problem with the connection between the server and the user and a Stripe callback cannot be made at the time of payment execution a Stripe webhook is used to complete the payment and safely store the order to the database.  
The Stripe webhook endpoint can be tested in 2 ways:  
1. By ommitting the form.send() command on the checkout page. This will force the server to initiate the callback using the webhook endpoint.  
2. Webhook endpoints can be manually triggered from the Stripe dashboard > webhooks. This will trigger a generic callback response to the endpoint provided.  

#### Securing the views test (Restricting certain functionality to registered users only)  
@login_required from django.contrib.auth.decorators  
Restricted content and functionality includes:  
- Functionality of adding, editing, or deleting a review.  
- Access to the Profile page.  
- Access to order_history content.  
- Access to Product Management pages. 
1. Log out and manually force a url to restricted content.  
2. Verify the content access is denied and the user is brought to the home page with an error message displayed. 
3. Verify that only the superuser has access to the Product Management page.
